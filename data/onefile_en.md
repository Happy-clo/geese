## I. Introduction

Are you already overwhelmed by the endless CRUD operations in your code? Frustrated with the need to install dependencies and set up environments just to build a simple webpage, followed by the never-ending updates?

OneFile is a single-file coding challenge designed to reignite your interest and joy in programming!

Write the code you want, using the simplest approach: **just one file**. Rediscover the original fun of programming.

## II. Requirements

When you step away from modern frameworks and libraries, your talent gets a chance to shine! If you have an idea, write it downâ€”maybe all you need is just one file.

The **OneFile** programming challenge requires:

- A single, uncompressed file smaller than 1 MB
- Clear code structure with comments, under 5000 lines
- Any programming language (Markdown-only files are not allowed)
- No external files (images, videos, CSS, etc.)
- Complete functionality with educational or practical value
- (Optional) Can depend on at most one open-source library or framework

Accepted projects will be promoted through HelloGitHub's social media accounts (200,000+ followers), helping your project reach and be loved by more people.

In addition to submitting your own work, you can also share projects found online, but remember to credit the author and source.
